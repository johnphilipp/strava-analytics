For my Dad’s 55th birthday, I wanted to make something a bit more special: Print 55 of his latest runs on a mug. Just how good would that morning coffee taste in such an accomplished mug…?

To do this, I built a Python/Streamlit-based application which implements OAuth2 for authentication to Strava’s V3 API and added three creative analytics features to display your geo-based sports activity data in new light.

## 1) Heatmap
Heatmaps, everybody loves them. So, of course, this was the first feature I implemented. The screenshot below shows a heatmap with almost 1,000 of my activites spread around the globe:

## 2) Poster
“Discover the art behind your activities” – This was the mantra behind the second feature I built. This feature allows you to display your geo-based activities on a collage:

Why not use this to create customized products (and gifts) based on someone's sports activity? Here are some examples I can think of:

## 3) Calendar
This feature is still a bit experimental, but the idea is to display a single-page calendar with all your activities (similar to a habit tracker):
